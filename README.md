## Add your bills to any calendar

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/bradpauly/billcalendar/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/bradpauly/billcalendar)

This is a rails 4 app that keeps track of all your bills and outputs them in iCalendar format so you can add them to any calendar that supports that format. It is also an experiment. I'm using it as a place to test ideas about how I write rails apps.

#### Goals/ideas of this experiment
- form objects because that's how it started
- simple, remove as much as possible including jQuery
- simple and relatively good looking, using http://getskeleton.com/
- fast, goes along with removing what isn't needed
- authentication credentials not tied to user
- useful, well, I'm using it anyway

Even though its an experiment, I released it into the wild.
