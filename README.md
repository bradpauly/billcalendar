## Add your bills to any calendar

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/bradpauly/billcalendar/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/bradpauly/billcalendar)

This is a rails 4 app that keeps track of all your bills and outputs them in iCalendar format so you can add them to any calendar that supports that format. It is also an experiment. I'm using it as a place to test ideas about how I write rails apps.

Even though its an experiment, I released it into the wild.
